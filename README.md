# 2024ASAS_Garcia-Launay

In order to import and use these materials, it is necessary to work with google colab at https://colab.research.google.com/
The first step is to open one of the jupyter notebooks available on the github repository - for instance FGL_NANP2024_Step0.ipynb
Then, add a new cell at the start of the notebook and paste the following command line
!git clone https://github.com/florencegarcialaunay/2024ASAS_Garcia-Launay.git

Then run this command line and check that the whole folder has been sent as a folder in Google colab

Then, add a new cell in the notebook and paste the following code in it
import sys
sys.path.insert(0,'/content/2024ASAS_Garcia-Launay')

Run this code.

Now all the python modules and inputfiles shoud be available.
